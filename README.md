# rust-pdf-reader

Saw a few posts about reading faster and displaying individual words on top of each other.
So wanted to make a pdf reader that could do that.

Focusing on the following steps:
1. Extracting the text from the pdf, keeping track of the page from which it came.
2. Extracting any relevant images on the current page and displaying them.
3. Show the text one word at a time with an adjustable speed slider.
4. Control to stop/start the word "playback", add contents page and viewer to help navigate through the pdf.
